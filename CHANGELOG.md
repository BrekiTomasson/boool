## v0.1.0 - First Public Release (2022-10-22)

This release should be considered **very** beta, and was only released to get a couple of outside opinions on the
package. The various methods may or may not keep their current names or aliases, so it is advised that you do not use
this package in any kind of production environment, as things **will** break in future versions.
